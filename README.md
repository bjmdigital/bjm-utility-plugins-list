# bjm-utility-plugins-list
This is a helper plugin to get a list of plugins that have any updates available. 

## Usage
To get the plugins list, add a query parameter to the url like this: `?bjm-plugins-list`

Once the query parameter is added, the plugin will create a table in the footer of the page with the list of all plugins.

Note: This will only work for the user logged-in as `administrator`
